a label generator for fastener inventory

## Installation

```
pip3 install blabel
```

That's it! Examples should now work.


## Hardware and Drivers
I'm using a [Dymo 450 Turbo](https://www.amazon.com/DYMO-LabelWriter-Thermal-Printer-1752264/dp/B0027JIIKQ?th=1) with [30336](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004Z60P/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)-size labels (54mm x 25mm).
The driver installation instructions for linux can be found [here](https://www.baitando.com/it/2017/12/12/install-dymo-labelwriter-on-headless-linux).
The only tweak is that the driver should be lw450t.ppd, not lw450.ppd.
